        <p>Crotalaria cobalitcola, or ‘fleur du cobalt’, is used to identify cobalt rich soils. Some other cobalt-tolerant plants will either succumb to cobalt toxicity at high concentrations or can also be found in areas without cobalt. This crotalaria fulfills both tests – it can tolerate high cobalt and does not grow in areas without it – so it is useful for deciding where to dig.</p>
