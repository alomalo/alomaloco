        <p>Cobalt is a key ingredient in the lithium ion batteries that make it possible for electronics to be portable. And it has a very geographically limited supply. Most cobalt (>60%) comes from these mines in the drc. It is usually extracted from the earth as a compound with arsenic or sulfur as a minor component of copper or nickel minerals.</p>
        <p>The word cobalt comes from the German word for "goblin". The first attempts to smelt those ores for copper or nickel resulted in puffs of blue powder (cobalt oxide) and very toxic, volatile arsenic oxide gas that was assumed to have supernatural origins.</p>
